# DeepDesign

Automated Design Library using Deep Neural Networks. The proposed method can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10352). The original source code can be found [here](https://github.com/loliverhennigh/Flow-Sculpter) although this repository is quite messy. A first version of this library will be available late February.
